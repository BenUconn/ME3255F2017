function [d,u]=lu_tridiag(e,f);
  % chol_tridiag calculates the components for Cholesky factorization of a symmetric
  % positive definite tridiagonal matrix
  % given its off-diagonal vector, e  
  % and diagonal vector f
  % the output is 
  % the diagonal of the Upper matrix, d
  % the off-diagonal of the Upper matrix, u
